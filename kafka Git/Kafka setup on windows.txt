// Kafka setup on windows

-> First install zip file from kafka official website
-> we will get zookeeper software with kafka zip file

-> after extracting the kafka zip file paste it in root directory like in c folder other wise we will get an error saying path is too lengthy.


// Run zookeeper first - default port 2181	
Open command prompt in location where bin folder is located in Kafka folder.

use following command to start zookeeper
C:\kafka_2.12-3.5.0\kafka_2.12-3.5.0>bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat config\zookeeper.properties
we should mention configuration also, in zookeeper.properties, file configurations are stored like port numbers etc.

// Run Kafka server secondly - default port 9092
Open a new command prompt in location where bin folder is located in kafka folder.

use following command to start kafka server
C:\kafka_2.12-3.5.0\kafka_2.12-3.5.0>bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat config\server.properties
